<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is my first major project as a beginner web developer. The overarching idea is to have a website
where horse people can go to find market pricing backed by real data. The site will include multiple formatting
options to view the data in. There will also be a few premium search options which will allow custom searching.</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>
